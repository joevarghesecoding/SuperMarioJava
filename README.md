# SuperMarioJava

I developed a Super Mario game to run in Raspberry Pi which is controlled by a Keyboard and outputted on a Monitor. I did not use a game engine to develop this game, instead took it as a chance to extend my practice with Java, OOP, and multithreading. Simply download the Jar file and run it.
Here are some screen shots:
